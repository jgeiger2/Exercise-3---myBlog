    <p><strong>Picture this:</strong> A disabled student on a swimming team. Doesn’t it seem like an oxymoron?</p>
    <p>The sound of the word “disabled” often conjures up images in people’s minds: a wheelchair-bound individual with no arms and legs; someone who can’t speak or is deaf and mute. But despite these assumptions, I am none of those things. When I was born, my doctor didn’t know if I had any life-threatening medical conditions. As it turns out, he couldn’t diagnose what was wrong with me until months later when doctors finally discovered that I have cerebral palsy (CP). My disability doesn’t stop me from doing anything that anyone else does!</p>
    <p>  During my elementary school years, I attended swimming lessons; however, I have no memories from that time.</p>

    <h3><em>Fast forward to high school.</em></h3>
    <p>In high school, though, I discovered that sports provided me with a feeling of accomplishment and collaboration that nothing else could. Never in a million years would I have guessed to join a sports team due to my cerebral palsy.</p>
    <p>I transferred high schools during my freshman and sophomore years, so I was starting a new one in the neighborhood. I’m not sure how it happened, but after giving it a shot, I ended up on the swim team!</p>
    <p>I genuinely liked being a part of the team. It was fantastic exercise for me; I stayed in incredible shape. The only stroke I could do well enough because of my cerebral palsy was the breast stroke.</p>
    <br>
    <h3><em>A surprising reaction</em></h3>
    <p>When I initially began, I was slower than molasses. I could swim 100 yards in around 5 minutes, but my teammates would take less than a minute and a half to complete the course, so the entire team always had to wait for me to finish. I felt terrible making the wait, but hey, I was having a good time.</p>
    <p>It was time for me to participate in my first swimming competition. I was apprehensive and tense. My race was near the end of the meet, so I had plenty of time to get ready. When it came to my turn, I busted my ass! During the first half of my race everyone was cheering for their respective team. Something amazing occurred during my last few laps; all eyes were focused on me since I was so slow. Because I was swimming for my life, I didn’t realize it. The whole pool would come to its feet and cheer for me at the end of my final lap. I would receive endless praises and fist bumps from my team, as well as the opposing team. Every meet for the rest of my swimming career would follow this pattern. That really boosted my confidence.</p>
    <p>At each meet, I’d get quicker and quicker. If I recall correctly, at my last competition, I finished in under three minutes!</p>
    <h3><em>Defy all expectations</em></h3>
    <p>My senior year was approaching, and we had a new coach. We named our team captains during our first meeting: one for the boys team and one for the girls team. I have no idea how this happened, but I was chosen as the boys’ swim team captain! To put it another way, I was absolutely astonished!</p>
    <p>That is what perseverance may accomplish. You may go to the stars if you never give up!</p>
    <p>My disability doesn’t stop me from doing anything that anyone else does! Nearly everyone has one or two disabilities and in the end we are all people with different stories. The most important thing is not our differences but what we can do despite them. And this, I believe is the most powerful message of all.</p>
